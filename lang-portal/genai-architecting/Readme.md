## Business Requirements

The main goal is to maintain the number of active students (300) as supportive and responsive as possible and to increase this number to 400 at least by end of the year. So the proposed infrastructure needs to acommodate this.

## Functional Requirements

Capability: The system will increase or decrease the scalablity automatically according to the number of access to the platform.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it's a trully open-source model with training data is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we are able to know what is going on in the model.
