Attempt -> Setup

Each state expects the following kinds of inputs and outputs:

## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- ensure there are no repeats eg. if miru verb is repeated twice, show it only once
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures
- reference the <file>examples.xml</file> for good structure examples.

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.
- The bird is black. → [Subject] [Adjective].
- The raven is in the garden. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb].
- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Location] [Object] [Verb].
- Did you see the raven? → [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
- Are you going? → [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? → [Object] [Verb]?
 -The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb].
 -I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].

### Clues and Considerations
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the japanese words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
