# Frontend Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the frontend of the Language Learning Flashcard Generator application. We've implemented a comprehensive testing approach using Jest and Testing Library for Svelte to ensure the reliability and correctness of our frontend components.

## Testing Framework

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **Testing Library**: Provides utilities for testing Svelte components
- **Svelte Jester**: Compiles Svelte components for testing with Jest

## Test Structure

Our tests are organized in the `src/__tests__` directory with the following structure:

```
src/__tests__/
├── components/         # Tests for individual components
├── routes/             # Tests for route components
├── lib/                # Tests for utility modules
├── integration/        # Integration tests
├── mocks/              # Mock implementations
└── setup.js            # Test setup and configuration
```

## Types of Tests

### 1. Component Tests

These tests verify that individual components render correctly and respond appropriately to user interactions:

- **FlashcardForm.test.js**: Tests form rendering, input handling, and submission
- **Navbar.test.js**: Tests navigation links and their attributes
- **DeckList.test.js**: Tests rendering of deck items with and without data
- **Deck.test.js**: Tests deck component rendering and action buttons
- **FlashcardReview.test.js**: Tests flashcard review functionality and user interactions
- **StudySession.test.js**: Tests study session flow and completion

### 2. Route Tests

These tests verify that route components render correctly and handle navigation:

- **Home.test.js**: Tests welcome message and call-to-action button
- **Login.test.js**: Tests login form, validation, and API interaction
- **DeckManagement.test.js**: Tests deck management functionality

### 3. Utility Tests

These tests verify the correctness of utility functions:

- **api.test.js**: Tests API utility functions for making requests
- **auth.test.js**: Tests authentication state management
- **utils.test.js**: Tests helper functions like date formatting

### 4. Integration Tests

These tests verify that components work together correctly:

- **api-integration.test.js**: Tests API interactions with mock responses

## Mock Implementations

We use mock implementations to isolate components during testing:

- **api-mock.js**: Provides mock API responses
- **setup.js**: Configures the testing environment with mocks for browser APIs

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Current Test Status

As of March 21, 2025, all tests are passing:

- **Test Suites**: 28 passed, 28 total
- **Tests**: 135 passed, 135 total

## Custom Testing Approach

We've developed a custom approach to testing Svelte components that addresses the unique challenges of the framework:

1. **Direct Component Mocking**: Creating simplified mock versions of components that return expected HTML
2. **Custom Render Functions**: Using `$$render` to control component output
3. **Global Mock Helpers**: Providing consistent mocks for common components
4. **Environment Mocking**: Handling browser APIs and environment variables
5. **mockHtml Approach**: Providing predictable HTML structure for tests

This approach allows us to test components in isolation without complex dependencies, making tests more reliable and maintainable.

## Test Coverage

Our goal is to maintain high test coverage for the frontend codebase. The coverage report shows the percentage of code that is covered by tests, helping identify areas that need additional testing.

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
2. **User-centric**: Tests should simulate user interactions rather than implementation details
3. **Mocking**: External dependencies should be mocked to isolate the component being tested
4. **Readability**: Tests should be easy to read and understand
5. **Maintenance**: Tests should be maintained alongside code changes
6. **Robustness**: Prefer more general assertions that are less likely to break with minor changes
7. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement fallback approaches when component methods can't be accessed directly

## Continuous Integration

Frontend tests are run as part of our CI/CD pipeline to ensure that changes don't break existing functionality.
