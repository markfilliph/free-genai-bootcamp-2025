# Test Improvement Plan

## Overview

Based on our current test coverage analysis and priorities, this document outlines a structured plan to improve test coverage for critical components in the Language Learning Flashcard Generator application. We'll focus on components with low coverage percentages and implement a phased approach to reach our coverage targets.

## Current Coverage Status

As of March 22, 2025, our test coverage shows several components with low coverage:

| Component | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines | Priority |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| StudySession.svelte | 77.73% | 37.75% | 57.5% | 84.1% | Critical |
| FlashcardReview.svelte | 1.98% | 0% | 0% | 1.98% | Critical |
| Login.svelte | 4.71% | 0% | 0% | 4.25% | Critical |
| Deck.svelte | 3.17% | 0% | 0% | 3.03% | Moderate |
| Navbar.svelte | 8.51% | 0% | 0% | 6.81% | Moderate |
| DeckManagement.svelte | 4.21% | 0% | 0% | 4.1% | Moderate |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Components (1-2 weeks)

#### 1. Login Component
- Implement tests for form validation
- Test API interaction for successful and failed login attempts
- Test error message display
- Test navigation after successful login
- Test token storage in localStorage

#### 2. FlashcardReview Component
- Test initial rendering with flashcard data
- Test flipping card functionality
- Test rating card functionality
- Test event dispatching for ratings
- Test error states and empty states

#### 3. StudySession Component
- Improve branch coverage for conditional logic
- Test session statistics tracking
- Test progress calculation
- Test session completion logic
- Test restart functionality

### Phase 2: Moderate Priority Components (2-4 weeks)

#### 1. Deck Component
- Test rendering with deck data
- Test action buttons (edit, delete, study)
- Test event dispatching
- Test error states

#### 2. Navbar Component
- Test rendering of navigation links
- Test active link highlighting
- Test responsive behavior
- Test authenticated vs. unauthenticated states

#### 3. DeckManagement Component
- Test deck listing
- Test deck creation form
- Test deck editing functionality
- Test deck deletion with confirmation
- Test error handling

### Phase 3: Integration and End-to-End Testing (1-2 months)

- Expand browser-based tests to cover more user flows
- Enhance Cypress end-to-end tests for complete user journeys
- Implement API error simulation tests
- Test edge cases like network failures and slow connections

## Implementation Approach

For each component, we'll follow this structured approach:

1. **Analysis**: Review component code to identify untested functionality
2. **Test Planning**: Create a list of test cases covering all functionality
3. **Implementation**: Write tests using our established testing patterns
4. **Verification**: Run tests and verify coverage improvements
5. **Documentation**: Update test documentation with new test cases

## Coverage Targets

We've set the following minimum coverage targets in our Jest configuration:

- **Critical Components**: 30% statements, 20% branches, 30% functions, 30% lines
- **Moderate Priority Components**: 20% statements, 15% branches, 20% functions, 20% lines
- **Global**: 50% statements, 40% branches, 50% functions, 50% lines

Our long-term goal is to achieve:

- **Critical Components**: 80% statements, 70% branches, 80% functions, 80% lines
- **All Components**: 70% statements, 60% branches, 70% functions, 70% lines

## Continuous Integration

We've set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on code changes. The workflow includes:

1. Running unit and integration tests
2. Generating coverage reports
3. Running Cypress end-to-end tests
4. Linting frontend and backend code

This ensures that our test coverage is maintained and improved over time.

## Conclusion

By following this structured approach, we'll systematically improve test coverage for all components, with a focus on critical components first. This will enhance the reliability and maintainability of our application while reducing the risk of regressions.
